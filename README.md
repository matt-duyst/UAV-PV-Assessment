# UAV Photovoltaic Arrays Assessment

## Overview
This cross-collaborative research project assessed the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) arrays on Yale University’s West Campus using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and thermal imagery. The study combined drone-based photogrammetry and thermal mosaicking to evaluate solar panel performance, offering insights for energy monitoring and maintenance.

## Flight Mission Details
We conducted UAV flights over Yale’s West Campus PV arrays, using DJI Phantom 4 Pro drones equipped with FLIR DUO R Dual-Sensor cameras. Data was collected at varying altitudes to generate detailed orthomosaics of the PV panels, including both RGB and thermal data.

## Image Acquisition and Processing
Thermal and RGB data were processed using Agisoft Metashape to create orthomosaics. The thermal data was particularly useful for identifying inefficiencies in the solar panels by mapping temperature variations.

## Results
Thermal mosaicking allowed for identification of underperforming panels, contributing to actionable insights for campus maintenance and energy efficiency.
